# WEEK2ASSIGNMENT
USER STORY
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

CHANGES DONE:
For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work.
It is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
I included a link to a PDF of my resume (not current).
I included a recent photo of myself.
The projects presented in the My Work section include a couple of sample programs I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
